Your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** is the secret sauce that powers Prezence AI's lead qualification. By telling the system exactly who you're looking for, you can ensure that the leads filling your pipeline are relevant and high-quality. This guide explains how to set up and refine your ICP.

## What is an ICP?

An ICP is a living description of your perfect customer. It's not just about demographics; it's about the specific characteristics of the companies and individuals who get the most value from your product or service. A well-defined ICP allows Prezence AI to sift through thousands of potential contacts on LinkedIn and surface only the ones that matter to you.

## Configuring Your ICP in Prezence AI

1.  **Go to ICP Settings**: From the main dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > **ICP Configuration**.

2.  **Fill Out the ICP Form**: You'll see a form with several fields to help you define your target audience. Be as specific as possible.

    -   **Job Titles**: Enter the job titles of the decision-makers you want to reach (e.g., "Head of Sales", "Marketing Manager").
    -   **Industries**: Select the industries your target customers operate in.
    -   **Company Size**: Specify the size of the companies you're targeting (e.g., 11-50 employees).
    -   **Location**: Define the geographic regions where your ideal customers are located.
    -   **Keywords**: Add keywords that might appear in a lead's LinkedIn profile summary or experience (e.g., "SaaS", "B2B Marketing").

3.  **Save Your Profile**: Once you're happy with your configuration, click the **"Save ICP"** button.

## How Prezence AI Uses Your ICP

Once saved, your ICP is used across the platform:

-   **Lead Scoring**: New and existing leads are automatically scored based on how well they match your ICP.
-   **Search Campaigns**: When you run a search campaign, it will use your ICP to find relevant new leads.
-   **Dashboard Filtering**: You can filter your lead dashboard to show only leads that are a strong match for your ICP.

With your ICP configured, you're ready to start exploring the [Leads Dashboard](/user-guides/lead-management/leads-dashboard) and see your qualified leads roll in.
