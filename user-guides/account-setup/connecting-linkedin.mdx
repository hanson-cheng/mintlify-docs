To unlock the full power of Prezence AI, you need to connect your LinkedIn account. This allows the app to import your leads, track conversations, and monitor engagement on your behalf. We've made this process simple and secure.

## Why Connect Your Account?

Connecting your LinkedIn account enables Prezence AI to:

- **Sync your conversations** into a unified inbox.
- **Import new leads** that match your Ideal Customer Profile.
- **Track engagement** on your posts to identify warm leads.
- **Automate outreach** through lead magnets and campaigns.

## How to Connect

1.  **Navigate to Settings**: From the main dashboard, click on the **Settings** icon in the left sidebar.

2.  **Find the LinkedIn Connection Section**: Look for the card titled "LinkedIn Account Connection".

3.  **Start the Connection Process**: Click the **"Connect Account"** button. You will be redirected to a secure portal to complete the connection.

## Our Secure Connection

We take the security of your account very seriously. That's why we use a trusted third-party integration to handle the connection to your LinkedIn account.

  - **No Stored Credentials**: Prezence AI never sees or stores your LinkedIn password. All authentication is handled directly by our secure integration partner.
  - **Secure Tokenization**: The integration uses secure tokens to communicate with LinkedIn, which means your credentials are not exposed.
  - **You're in Control**: You can disconnect your account from Prezence AI at any time from the settings page.

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you encounter any problems while connecting your account, here are a few things to try:

- **Disable VPNs**: Sometimes a VPN can interfere with the connection process.
- **Check for LinkedIn Updates**: Ensure you are logged into LinkedIn in another browser tab and that there are no pending security alerts from LinkedIn.
- **Contact Support**: If you're still having trouble, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Once your account is connected, you're ready to start defining your [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](/user-guides/account-setup/ideal-customer-profile) to begin qualifying leads.
