While [Lead Magnets](/user-guides/automation-campaigns/lead-magnets) are great for capturing leads from your own content, **Comment Monitoring** allows you to cast a wider net. With this feature, you can monitor the comment section of *any* public LinkedIn post—from industry influencers, competitors, or news outlets—to find potential leads who are actively engaging in relevant discussions.

## Why Monitor Comments?

-   **Discover Active Buyers**: People commenting on posts related to your industry are often actively looking for solutions.
-   **Understand Pain Points**: The language people use in comments can reveal their biggest challenges and needs.
-   **Engage Organically**: It provides a natural entry point for you to join the conversation and offer value before you pitch.

## How to Set Up Comment Monitoring

1.  **Find a Post to Monitor**: Identify a popular LinkedIn post that is relevant to your target audience.

2.  **Go to Comment Monitoring**: In Prezence AI, navigate to the **Comment Monitoring** section within Automation & Campaigns.

3.  **Add the Post**: Click **"Monitor New Post"** and paste the URL of the LinkedIn post.

4.  **Set Your Criteria**: You can choose to:
    -   **Import all commenters** as new leads.
    -   **Filter by keywords**: Only import commenters whose comments contain specific keywords (e.g., "looking for a tool", "recommendation?").

5.  **Start Monitoring**: Activate the monitor, and Prezence AI will begin analyzing the comments and importing matching profiles into your "New" lead pipeline.

Comment monitoring is a proactive way to find leads who are already talking about the problems you solve. The final automation tool to explore is [Search Campaigns](/user-guides/automation-campaigns/search-campaigns), which helps you find leads who aren't yet in a conversation.
