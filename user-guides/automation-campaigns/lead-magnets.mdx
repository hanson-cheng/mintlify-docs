Imagine posting an insightful article on LinkedIn and having new, interested leads automatically added to your pipeline. That's the power of **Lead Magnets** in Prezence AI. This feature turns your content into a lead generation machine.

## What is a Lead Magnet?

A lead magnet is a compelling offer you make to your audience in exchange for their engagement. In the context of LinkedIn, it's typically a valuable resource (like a PDF, a link to a private video, or a template) that you promise to send to people who comment on your post.

## How Lead Magnets Work in Prezence AI

The process is simple and automated:

1.  **You create a post** on LinkedIn offering a valuable resource.
2.  **You create a Lead Magnet** in Prezence AI and link it to that specific LinkedIn post.
3.  When someone comments on your post, Prezence AI automatically:
    -   Adds that person as a new lead in your pipeline.
    -   Sends them a direct message on LinkedIn with a link to the resource.

This saves you countless hours of manually tracking comments and sending DMs.

## Setting Up a Lead Magnet

1.  **Navigate to Lead Magnets**: From the dashboard, go to the **Lead Magnets** section.

2.  **Create a New Lead Magnet**: Click **"New Lead Magnet"**.

3.  **Configure the Details**:
    -   **Name**: Give your lead magnet a descriptive name.
    -   **LinkedIn Post URL**: Paste the URL of the LinkedIn post you want to monitor.
    -   **Resource URL**: Paste the link to the resource you're offering (e.g., a Google Drive link, a Dropbox link).
    -   **Reply Message**: Craft the message that will be automatically sent to people who comment. You can use placeholders like `{{firstName}}` to personalize it.

4.  **Activate the Lead Magnet**: Once you're happy with the setup, activate it. Prezence AI will now start monitoring your post for new comments.

<Card title="Example Reply Message">
  "Hi {{firstName}}, thanks for your interest! As promised, here's the link to the [Resource Name]: [Your Resource URL]. Hope you find it valuable!"
</Card>
