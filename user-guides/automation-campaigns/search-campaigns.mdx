While other automation features help you capture inbound interest, **Search Campaigns** empower you to go out and find new leads. This feature automates the process of searching LinkedIn for profiles that match your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and importing them directly into your pipeline.

## Why Use Search Campaigns?

-   **Proactive Lead Gen**: Don't wait for leads to come to you. Actively seek out prospects who fit your criteria.
-   **Time-Saving**: Automate the tedious process of manually searching LinkedIn and vetting profiles.
-   **Consistent Pipeline Growth**: Keep a steady stream of new, qualified leads flowing into the top of your funnel.

## How to Launch a Search Campaign

1.  **Ensure Your ICP is Solid**: The success of your search campaign depends heavily on a well-defined [ICP](/user-guides/account-setup/ideal-customer-profile). Make sure it's configured before you start.

2.  **Navigate to Search Campaigns**: In Prezence AI, go to the **Search Campaigns** section.

3.  **Create a New Campaign**: Click **"New Search Campaign"**.

4.  **Configure Your Campaign**:
    -   **Campaign Name**: Give your campaign a memorable name (e.g., "Q3 Marketing Managers Campaign").
    -   **Target ICP**: Select the ICP you want to use for this search.
    -   **Search Limits**: Define how many profiles you want the campaign to find per day to ensure a natural and safe search volume.

5.  **Launch the Campaign**: Activate the campaign, and Prezence AI will start running searches on LinkedIn on your behalf. New leads that match your criteria will be automatically added to your pipeline.

  Instead of one broad campaign, try running multiple, highly-specific campaigns. For example, create separate campaigns for different job titles or industries. This can lead to higher quality results and allow for more personalized initial outreach.
