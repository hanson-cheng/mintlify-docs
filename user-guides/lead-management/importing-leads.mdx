An empty pipeline is a sad pipeline. Let's get it filled with high-quality leads! Prezence AI offers several ways to import leads, so you can choose the method that best fits your workflow.

## Method 1: Automated Importing with Search Campaigns

The most powerful way to import leads is by using **Search Campaigns**. This feature allows you to automate the process of finding and importing people on LinkedIn who match your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

1.  **Set Up Your ICP**: Before you can run a search campaign, make sure your [ICP is configured](/user-guides/account-setup/ideal-customer-profile).
2.  **Create a Campaign**: Navigate to the **Search Campaigns** section and click "New Campaign".
3.  **Define Your Search**: Give your campaign a name and confirm the ICP you want to use.
4.  **Launch**: Start the campaign, and Prezence AI will begin searching for matching profiles on LinkedIn and automatically adding them to your "New" pipeline stage.

## Method 2: Importing from a LinkedIn Search URL

Have you already run a search on LinkedIn and have a list of people you want to import? You can simply paste the LinkedIn search URL into Prezence AI.

1.  **Perform a Search on LinkedIn**: Go to LinkedIn and run a search for the people you want to import.
2.  **Copy the URL**: Copy the entire URL from your browser's address bar.
3.  **Import in Prezence AI**: In the Leads Dashboard, click the **"Import Leads"** button and select "Import from URL". Paste the URL and Prezence AI will import the profiles from that search result page.

## Method 3: Manual Lead Creation

Sometimes you might have a single, high-value lead you want to add quickly.

1.  **Click "Add Lead"**: From the Leads Dashboard, click the **"Add Lead"** button.
2.  **Enter LinkedIn Profile URL**: Paste the URL of the individual's LinkedIn profile.
3.  **Add to Pipeline**: Prezence AI will fetch their profile information and add them as a new lead in your pipeline.

Now that you know how to import leads, the next step is to learn how to effectively manage them using [Pipeline Stages](/user-guides/lead-management/managing-pipeline-stages).
