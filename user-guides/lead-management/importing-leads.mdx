An empty pipeline is a sad pipeline. Let's get it filled with high-quality leads! Prezence AI offers several ways to import leads, so you can choose the method that best fits your workflow.

## Method 1: Automated Importing with Search Campaigns

The most powerful way to import leads is by using **Search Campaigns**. This feature allows you to automate the process of finding and importing people on LinkedIn who match your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

1.  **Set Up Your ICP**: Before you can run a search campaign, make sure your [ICP is configured](/user-guides/account-setup/ideal-customer-profile).
2.  **Create a Campaign**: Navigate to the **Search Campaigns** section and click "New Campaign".
3.  **Define Your Search**: Give your campaign a name and confirm the ICP you want to use.
4.  **Launch**: Start the campaign, and Prezence AI will begin searching for matching profiles on LinkedIn and automatically adding them to your "New" pipeline stage.

## Method 2: Importing from a LinkedIn Search URL

Have you already run a search on LinkedIn and have a list of people you want to import? You can simply paste the LinkedIn search URL into Prezence AI.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify Your Target Audience**:
   - Determine the job titles or roles that match your ICP
   - Consider using AI tools like Claude to generate a comprehensive list of relevant job titles

2. **Create Labels for Organization**:
   - Before importing leads, create labels in Settings to categorize your leads
   - These labels will help you organize and filter your leads later

3. **Perform a Search on LinkedIn**:
   - Go to LinkedIn and search for your target job titles
   - Use the "1st" filter to find people you're already connected with
   - You can further refine by location or other criteria using "All Filters"

4. **Copy the Search URL**:
   - After running your search, copy the entire URL from your browser's address bar

5. **Import in Prezence AI**:
   - In Prezence AI, go to the Searches section
   - Click "Add Search"
   - Name your search (e.g., "SDR Demo")
   - Paste the LinkedIn search URL
   - Select the appropriate label for these leads
   - Click "Save"

6. **Working with Imported Leads**:
   - After a few hours, your leads will appear in the "New Leads" section
   - You can filter by connection tier:
     - Tier 1: Already connected (ready to message)
     - Tier 2/3: Not connected (need to send connection requests first)
   - Select leads and use "Send Invitation" to queue connection requests
   - Connection requests are sent gradually (every 30 seconds to 2 minutes) to stay within LinkedIn limits

7. **Creating Custom Views**:
   - Filter your leads by connection status, labels, or other criteria
   - Save these filters as custom views for quick access
   - Use these views to efficiently work through your outreach process

## Method 3: Manual Lead Creation

Sometimes you might have a single, high-value lead you want to add quickly.

1.  **Click "Add Lead"**: From the Leads Dashboard, click the **"Add Lead"** button.
2.  **Enter LinkedIn Profile URL**: Paste the URL of the individual's LinkedIn profile.
3.  **Add to Pipeline**: Prezence AI will fetch their profile information and add them as a new lead in your pipeline.

Now that you know how to import leads, the next step is to learn how to effectively manage them using [Pipeline Stages](/user-guides/lead-management/managing-pipeline-stages).
