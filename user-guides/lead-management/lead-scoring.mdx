Not all leads are created equal. Some are ready to buy, while others are just starting their journey. Lead scoring is the process of automatically assigning a value to each lead to represent how qualified they are. In Prezence AI, this helps you instantly identify your hottest prospects so you can focus your energy where it counts.

## How Lead Scoring Works

Prezence AI's lead scoring engine works in the background, analyzing every lead in your pipeline against your [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](/user-guides/account-setup/ideal-customer-profile). 

The score is based on a simple principle: the more a lead's profile matches the criteria you set in your ICP, the higher their score will be.

Points are awarded for matches in:
- Job Title
- Industry
- Company Size
- Location
- Keywords in their profile

## Where to Find the Lead Score

The lead score is displayed prominently in a few key places:

- **On the Lead Card**: You'll see a score badge on each lead's card in the pipeline view, giving you an at-a-glance understanding of their quality.
- **In the Lead Detail View**: For a more detailed breakdown, open any lead to see their score and which ICP criteria they matched.

## Using Lead Scores to Work Smarter

Lead scoring isn't just a number; it's a tool for prioritization. Here's how to use it:

### 1. Filter Your Dashboard

Use the filters at the top of the Leads Dashboard to view only leads above a certain score. For example, you could filter to see only leads with a score of 80 or higher to focus on your most qualified prospects for the day.

### 2. Create a "Hot Leads" View

Create a [Custom View](/user-guides/lead-management/leads-dashboard) that automatically shows you high-scoring leads. This can be your go-to list for daily outreach.

### 3. Personalize Your Outreach

When you see a lead with a high score, you can be more confident in investing time to personalize your outreach message. You know they're a good fit, so the extra effort is more likely to pay off.

By leveraging automated lead scoring, you can move away from guessing and start making data-driven decisions about who to engage with next.

### How to Configure Your Lead Scoring Agent

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - You must have your LLM API keys set up (see [LLM Configuration](/user-guides/settings-administration/llm-configuration))
   - Lead scoring is most valuable when you have many connections/leads to prioritize

2. **Selecting Your LLM Provider**:
   - Choose your preferred provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Open Router)
   - For cost efficiency, consider using Open Router with models like Maverick
   - Copy the model name from Open Router and paste it into the model field

3. **Understanding the Scoring System**:
   - Leads are scored on a scale of 0-100
   - Higher scores (60+) indicate better alignment with your ICP
   - Lower scores (<40) indicate leads that are less likely to be a good fit

4. **Configuring the Agent**:
   - The system uses dynamic variables to input lead information
   - You can test your agent configuration before making it live
   - For efficiency, the system uses only headline information to avoid excessive profile views

5. **Using Lead Scores**:
   - Once the agent is live, leads will be automatically scored
   - In the Conversations view, you can sort leads by score (high to low)
   - Prioritize your outreach to the highest-scoring leads first

This lead scoring system helps you focus your time and energy on the most promising prospects, especially when dealing with large numbers of potential leads.
