Not all leads are created equal. Some are ready to buy, while others are just starting their journey. Lead scoring is the process of automatically assigning a value to each lead to represent how qualified they are. In Prezence AI, this helps you instantly identify your hottest prospects so you can focus your energy where it counts.

## How Lead Scoring Works

Prezence AI's lead scoring engine works in the background, analyzing every lead in your pipeline against your [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](/user-guides/account-setup/ideal-customer-profile). 

The score is based on a simple principle: the more a lead's profile matches the criteria you set in your ICP, the higher their score will be.

Points are awarded for matches in:
- Job Title
- Industry
- Company Size
- Location
- Keywords in their profile

## Where to Find the Lead Score

The lead score is displayed prominently in a few key places:

- **On the Lead Card**: You'll see a score badge on each lead's card in the pipeline view, giving you an at-a-glance understanding of their quality.
- **In the Lead Detail View**: For a more detailed breakdown, open any lead to see their score and which ICP criteria they matched.

## Using Lead Scores to Work Smarter

Lead scoring isn't just a number; it's a tool for prioritization. Here's how to use it:

### 1. Filter Your Dashboard

Use the filters at the top of the Leads Dashboard to view only leads above a certain score. For example, you could filter to see only leads with a score of 80 or higher to focus on your most qualified prospects for the day.

### 2. Create a "Hot Leads" View

Create a [Custom View](/user-guides/lead-management/leads-dashboard) that automatically shows you high-scoring leads. This can be your go-to list for daily outreach.

### 3. Personalize Your Outreach

When you see a lead with a high score, you can be more confident in investing time to personalize your outreach message. You know they're a good fit, so the extra effort is more likely to pay off.

By leveraging automated lead scoring, you can move away from guessing and start making data-driven decisions about who to engage with next. This concludes our Lead Management section. Next, let's explore the [Conversation Hub](/user-guides/engagement-conversations/conversation-hub).
