title: Managing Pipeline Stages
description: How to customize your sales pipeline for maximum efficiency.

Your sales pipeline is the backbone of your lead management process in Prezence AI. It provides a visual representation of where each lead stands in their journey with you. While Prezence AI comes with a set of default stages, you can—and should—customize them to perfectly match your sales workflow.

## Understanding the Pipeline

The pipeline on your [Leads Dashboard](/user-guides/lead-management/leads-dashboard) is a Kanban-style board where each column is a stage. Leads move from left to right as they progress from a new prospect to a happy customer.

## Moving Leads Between Stages

Moving a lead is as simple as clicking and dragging.

1.  **Click and hold** the lead card you want to move.
2.  **Drag it** to the desired stage column.
3.  **Release** the mouse button to drop it in place.

This action instantly updates the lead's status, keeping your pipeline organized and up-to-date.

## Customizing Your Pipeline Stages

To tailor the pipeline to your needs, you can add, edit, reorder, or delete stages.

1.  **Navigate to Settings**: Go to **Settings** > **Pipeline Stages Manager**.
2.  Here you'll see a list of your current pipeline stages.

### Adding a New Stage

- Click the **"Add New Stage"** button.
- Give your new stage a name (e.g., "Follow-Up Sent", "Demo Booked").
- Click **"Save"**.

### Editing a Stage

- Click the **edit icon** next to the stage you want to change.
- Rename the stage and click **"Save"**.

### Reordering Stages

- **Click and drag** the handle next to a stage's name.
- Move it up or down in the list to change its position in the pipeline.
- The order is saved automatically.

### Deleting a Stage

- Click the **delete icon** next to the stage you want to remove.
- <Warning>Be careful! If you delete a stage that contains leads, you will be prompted to move those leads to another stage before the deletion can be completed.</Warning>

  A good pipeline is a simple pipeline. Aim for 5-7 core stages that clearly define a significant step in your sales process. Too many stages can make your pipeline difficult to manage.
