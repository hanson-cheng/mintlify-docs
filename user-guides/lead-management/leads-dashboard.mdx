The Leads Dashboard is where you'll manage, track, and interact with all your leads. Think of it as your command center for LinkedIn lead generation. This guide will walk you through the key components of the dashboard.

## Navigating the Dashboard

When you log in, you'll land on the main Leads Dashboard. Here's what you'll see:

### 1. The Pipeline View

The most prominent feature is the **Pipeline View**, which displays your leads as cards organized into columns. Each column represents a stage in your sales process.

- **Drag and Drop**: You can easily move a lead from one stage to the next by simply dragging and dropping their card.
- **At-a-Glance Info**: Each lead card shows key information, including their name, job title, and ICP score.

### 2. Standard Views

On the left sidebar, you'll find **Standard Views**. These are pre-built filters to help you quickly access important segments of your leads:

- **All Leads**: See every lead in your system.
- **Needs Contact**: This crucial view shows you all the leads that are waiting for you to reach out. Stay on top of this list to ensure no opportunity slips through the cracks.
- **Hot Leads**: View leads with a high ICP score who have recently engaged with your content.

### 3. Custom Views

For more granular control, you can create **Custom Views**. This allows you to save specific combinations of filters that you use frequently. For example, you could create a custom view for "Marketing Managers in the SaaS industry that I haven't contacted this month."

### 4. Filtering and Searching

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find powerful **filtering and searching** options:

- **Search Bar**: Quickly find a specific lead by name or company.
- **Filter Dropdowns**: Filter your leads by:
  - ICP Score
  - Pipeline Stage
  - Last Contact Date
  - Custom Tags

## The Lead Detail View

Clicking on any lead card will open the **Lead Detail View**. This is where you can see all the information about a single lead, including their full profile, conversation history, and activity feed.

Now that you're familiar with the dashboard, it's time to start filling it with leads. Learn how in our next guide: [Importing Leads](/user-guides/lead-management/importing-leads).
