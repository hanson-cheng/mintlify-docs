title: Monitoring LinkedIn Activity
description: Keep track of your leads' public engagement to find the perfect time to reach out.

Conversations don't just happen in the inbox. A lead's public activity on LinkedIn—the posts they like, the comments they leave, the articles they share—is a goldmine of information. Prezence AI helps you tap into this by tracking the LinkedIn activity of your leads.

## Why Track LinkedIn Activity?

Monitoring a lead's public engagement helps you:

-   **Identify Buying Signals**: A lead suddenly liking several posts about a problem your product solves is a strong signal of interest.
-   **Find Conversation Starters**: Mentioning a recent comment they made or a post they shared is a great way to start a relevant, non-generic conversation.
-   **Stay Top-of-Mind**: Engaging with their content (thoughtfully!) keeps you on their radar.

## The LinkedIn Activity Feed

For every lead in your pipeline, Prezence AI maintains an **Activity Feed**. You can find this feed within the **Lead Detail View**.

### What's Tracked?

The feed captures a variety of important engagement signals:

-   **Likes**: See the posts and articles your leads are liking.
-   **Comments**: Track the comments they leave on other people's content.
-   **Posts**: Get notified when they publish their own posts or articles on LinkedIn.

## Turning Insights into Action

Here's a simple example of how to use this feature:

1.  You see in the Activity Feed that a high-potential lead has commented on a post about the challenges of remote team management.
2.  Instead of a generic follow-up, you can send a message like:

    > "Hi [Lead Name], I saw your comment on that post about remote teams. Your point about [mention their specific point] was spot on. It actually reminded me of a case study we did on how [Client] solved that exact issue. Thought you might find it interesting."

This level of personalization shows you're paying attention and can dramatically increase your response rates.

This concludes the "Engagement & Conversations" section. Now, let's put your lead generation on autopilot with the [Automation & Campaigns](/user-guides/automation-campaigns/lead-magnets) guides.
