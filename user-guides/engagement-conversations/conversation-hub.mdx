Juggling conversations across LinkedIn's messaging, email, and other platforms can be a major headache. The **Conversation Hub** in Prezence AI solves this by bringing all your lead communications into a single, powerful, and organized interface.

## Welcome to Your Unified Inbox

The Conversation Hub is designed to feel familiar, like an email client, but it's supercharged with features specifically for lead management.

### Key Components

1.  **Conversation List**: On the left, you'll see a list of all your ongoing conversations, sorted by the most recent activity. Unread messages are highlighted, so you can quickly see what needs your attention.

2.  **Message Pane**: The central area displays the full history of your conversation with a selected lead. You can scroll through all past messages to get complete context.

3.  **Composer**: At the bottom, you'll find the message composer. This is where you can write and send replies directly to your leads on LinkedIn without ever leaving Prezence AI.

4.  **Lead Context Panel**: On the right, you get a full view of the lead you're talking to. This panel shows their profile information, pipeline stage, ICP score, and any notes you've added. This means you have all the context you need to write a personalized and relevant message.

## Powerful Features

The Conversation Hub is more than just an inbox. It's packed with tools to make you more efficient.

-   **Message Templates**: Create and save reusable message templates for common scenarios like follow-ups or answering frequently asked questions. Access them with a single click from the composer.
-   **AI-Assisted Replies**: (Coming Soon) Get suggestions from our AI to help you craft the perfect response.
-   **Snooze Conversations**: Temporarily hide a conversation from your inbox and have it reappear at a later time. Perfect for following up.

By centralizing your communications, the Conversation Hub ensures that no conversation falls through the cracks and that you always have the full picture before you hit "send".
