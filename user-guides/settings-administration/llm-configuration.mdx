description: How to connect your own Large Language Model (LLM) API keys.
---

Prezence AI leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for features like AI-assisted messaging and content analysis. While we provide a default AI model, you have the option to connect your own API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

## Why Bring Your Own Key?

-   **Control Your Costs**: Pay your provider directly for your usage.
-   **Choose Your Preferred Model**: Use the specific model that you find works best for your needs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3).
-   **Higher Rate Limits**: Benefit from any higher rate limits associated with your personal or business account.

## How to Add Your API Key

1.  **Navigate to Settings**: Go to **Settings** > **LLM Configuration**.
2.  **Select Your Provider**: Choose the LLM provider you want to use from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Enter Your API Key**: Paste your API key into the secure input field.
4.  **Save and Test**: Click **"Save & Test Connection"**. Prezence AI will make a small test call to ensure the key is valid and working.

<Warning>
  Your API keys are stored securely and encrypted. Never share your API keys publicly.

### Cost-Effective LLM Options

The video demonstrates how to set up your LLM configuration with a focus on cost-effectiveness:

1. **Available LLM Providers**:
   - OpenAI
   - Anthropic
   - Open Router (recommended for cost efficiency)

2. **Why Choose Open Router**:
   - Access to multiple models (including Anthropic, Claude, etc.) through a single API
   - Pay-as-you-go pricing with minimal markup (approximately 6%)
   - Access to more affordable models like Maverick/Llama

3. **Cost Examples**:
   - Using cost-effective models can keep expenses very low (e.g., less than $1/week with regular usage)
   - Pricing comparison: Maverick costs approximately 15¢ per million input tokens and 60¢ per million output tokens
   - More expensive models like Claude might cost roughly 10x more

4. **Getting Started**:
   - Create an account with your preferred provider
   - Generate an API key
   - Add the key to your Prezence AI settings

This configuration allows Prezence AI to use your preferred LLM for lead scoring, message generation, and other AI-powered features.
