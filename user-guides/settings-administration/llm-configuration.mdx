Prezence AI leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for features like AI-assisted messaging and content analysis. While we provide a default AI model, you have the option to connect your own API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

## Why Bring Your Own Key?

-   **Control Your Costs**: Pay your provider directly for your usage.
-   **Choose Your Preferred Model**: Use the specific model that you find works best for your needs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3).
-   **Higher Rate Limits**: Benefit from any higher rate limits associated with your personal or business account.

## How to Add Your API Key

1.  **Navigate to Settings**: Go to **Settings** > **LLM Configuration**.
2.  **Select Your Provider**: Choose the LLM provider you want to use from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Enter Your API Key**: Paste your API key into the secure input field.
4.  **Save and Test**: Click **"Save & Test Connection"**. Prezence AI will make a small test call to ensure the key is valid and working.

<Warning>
  Your API keys are stored securely and encrypted. Never share your API keys publicly.
