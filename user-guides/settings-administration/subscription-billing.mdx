This guide explains how to manage your subscription plan, update your payment method, and access your invoices.

## Managing Your Subscription

1.  **Navigate to Settings**: Go to **Settings** > **Subscription & Billing**.
2.  Here you will see:
    -   **Your Current Plan**: The details of your active subscription.
    -   **Usage Quotas**: How much of your monthly or annual quota you've used (e.g., number of leads, seats).

### Upgrading or Downgrading

-   Click the **"Change Plan"** button to see all available plans.
-   Select the plan you want to switch to and confirm the changes.
-   Prorated charges or credits will be calculated automatically.

## Updating Your Payment Method

-   In the **Billing** section, you can securely update your credit card information.
-   We partner with Stripe for all payment processing, so your details are never stored on our servers.

## Viewing Invoices

-   You can view and download all your past invoices for your records from the **Invoice History** table.
