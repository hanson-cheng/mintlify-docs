The system intelligently monitors:
- Comments on your LinkedIn posts
- Reactions to your content
- Direct messages requesting resources
- Specific trigger phrases or keywords
- Engagement patterns indicating interest

When the system detects engagement that signals interest in your content, it automatically initiates the lead magnet delivery process.

### Lead Magnet Request Detection

Using advanced AI analysis, the system can:

- Identify when comments are requesting resources
- Recognize various ways users might ask for information
- Detect indirect expressions of interest
- Understand context-specific requests
- Filter out irrelevant or spam comments

This ensures that lead magnets are only delivered to genuinely interested prospects.

### Automated Delivery Process

Once interest is detected, the system:

1. Sends a personalized message to the prospect
2. Delivers the appropriate lead magnet based on the content they engaged with
3. Follows up with additional information if needed
4. Moves the lead into the appropriate pipeline stage
5. Applies relevant custom labels for segmentation
