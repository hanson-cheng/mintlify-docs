This guide will walk you through the steps to get the Prezence AI application running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn
-   A Supabase account (for database and auth)
-   A Stripe account (for testing billing features)

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanson-cheng/linkedinleads-hub.git
cd linkedinleads-hub
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

-   Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    ```
-   Open `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase project URL and anon key.
-   For local development, you can set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_AUTH=true` to skip authentication.

## 4. Set Up the Database

-   In your Supabase project dashboard, go to the SQL Editor.
-   Run the SQL scripts located in the `/supabase/migrations` directory in the correct order.

## 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
