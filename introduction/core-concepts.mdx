To get the most out of Prezence AI, it's helpful to understand a few core concepts. This page breaks down the key terminology you'll encounter throughout the app.

## Leads

A **Lead** is a person who has shown interest in your product or service, typically through an interaction on LinkedIn. In Prezence AI, a lead is more than just a contact; it's a profile enriched with data from their LinkedIn activity, conversations, and your own notes.

## Pipeline Stages

**Pipeline Stages** are the steps in your sales process. They represent a lead's journey from initial contact to becoming a customer. Prezence AI comes with a default set of stages, but you can customize them to match your unique workflow.

Common stages include:
- **New**: A freshly imported or discovered lead.
- **Contacted**: You've reached out to the lead.
- **In Conversation**: A two-way dialogue has started.
- **Qualified**: The lead meets your criteria and is a good fit.
- **Closed/Won**: The lead has become a customer.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** is a set of criteria that defines your perfect customer. In Prezence AI, you configure your ICP with attributes like industry, job title, company size, and keywords from their profile. The app then uses this ICP to automatically score leads, helping you prioritize who to talk to first.

## Lead Magnets

A **Lead Magnet** is a valuable piece of content you offer to prospects in exchange for their engagement. This could be a whitepaper, a case study, a free tool, or an insightful article. In Prezence AI, you can create and manage lead magnets to automatically capture interest from people who comment on your LinkedIn posts, turning passive readers into active leads.

## Search Campaigns

**Search Campaigns** are automated searches you can run on LinkedIn to find new leads that match your ICP. Instead of manually searching for people every day, you can set up a campaign in Prezence AI to continuously find and import new, relevant leads into your pipeline.

Understanding these concepts will give you a solid foundation for using Prezence AI effectively. Now you're ready to dive into the [User Guides](/user-guides/account-setup/creating-your-account) for step-by-step instructions on each feature.
